 <h2>About Us</h2>
 <p>The passion for coffee and tea comes from living in Europe for four years three of which were based in Italy. In Italy coffee is a beverage and an experience but it starts with good coffee.  Whether it was an espresso first thing in the morning, a cappuccino by 11am, caf√© Americano in the afternoon or an espresso after dinner the rich flavor and aroma of the coffee was always accompanied with experiential fellowship or warm memories. Coming into contact with cultures from the UK and Asia brought about an appreciation for the taste and aromatic properties of quality teas. Upon returning to the US and now living in Charlotte, NC and unable to find similar products, I began roasting green coffee beans in my garage to perfect the desired blends. Next specific loose teas were sampled to obtain the best black and green varieties. The result is a wonderful selection of single origin and specialty blend coffees along with a collection of satisfying teas that will bring other parts of world to you. With the special array of organic coffee and tea provided by Coppa Coffee and Tea, try them and experience the difference.</p>
